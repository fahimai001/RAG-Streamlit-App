      "content='Okay, let\\'s break down how AI works. It\\'s a broad field, so I\\'ll give you a general overview, then dive into some key concepts and techniques.\\n\\n**Core Idea: Mimicking Intelligence**\\n\\nAt its heart, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about creating computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes things like:\\n\\n*   **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.\\n*   **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach conclusions (either exact or approximate).\\n*   **Problem Solving:**  Finding solutions to complex issues.\\n*   **Perception:**  Interpreting sensory data (like images, sound, or text).\\n*   **Natural Language Understanding:**  Comprehending and generating human language.\\n\\n**Key Components and Approaches**\\n\\nAI isn\\'t a single technology; it\\'s an umbrella term for various techniques. Here are some of the most important:\\n\\n1.  **Machine Learning (ML):**\\n\\n    *   **What it is:** This is the most common approach to AI today. Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data.  The more data they have, the better they become at making predictions or decisions.\\n\\n    *   **How it works:**\\n        *   **Data Collection:** Gather a large dataset relevant to the task.\\n        *   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose an appropriate ML algorithm (see types below).\\n        *   **Training:** Feed the data into the algorithm. The algorithm adjusts its internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions.\\n        *   **Testing/Validation:**  Evaluate the algorithm\\'s performance on a separate dataset to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.\\n        *   **Deployment:** Integrate the trained model into an application or system.\\n\\n    *   **Types of Machine Learning:**\\n        *   **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from labeled data (data where the correct answer is provided).  Examples:\\n            *   *Classification:*  Predicting a category (e.g., is this email spam or not spam?).  Algorithms include:\\n                *   *Logistic Regression*\\n                *   *Support Vector Machines (SVMs)*\\n                *   *Decision Trees*\\n                *   *Random Forests*\\n            *   *Regression:* Predicting a continuous value (e.g., what will the price of this house be?). Algorithms include:\\n                *   *Linear Regression*\\n                *   *Polynomial Regression*\\n        *   **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, finding patterns and structures on its own. Examples:\\n            *   *Clustering:* Grouping similar data points together (e.g., segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior). Algorithms include:\\n                *   *K-Means Clustering*\\n                *   *Hierarchical Clustering*\\n            *   *Dimensionality Reduction:* Reducing the number of variables in a dataset while preserving important information (e.g., simplifying complex data for visualization).  Algorithms include:\\n                *   *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*\\n        *   **Reinforcement Learning:** The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.  It aims to learn a policy that maximizes its cumulative reward.  Examples:\\n            *   Training a game-playing AI (e.g., AlphaGo).\\n            *   Robotics control.\\n            *   Algorithms include:\\n                *   *Q-Learning*\\n                *   *Deep Q-Networks (DQN)*\\n\\n2.  **Deep Learning (DL):**\\n\\n    *   **What it is:** A subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\"). These networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain.\\n\\n    *   **How it works:** Deep learning models learn hierarchical representations of data.  Each layer in the network extracts increasingly complex features from the input. For example, in image recognition:\\n        *   *First layer:* Might detect edges and corners.\\n        *   *Second layer:* Might combine edges and corners to form shapes.\\n        *   *Third layer:* Might combine shapes to form objects (e.g., eyes, noses).\\n        *   *Final layer:*  Identifies the object (e.g., a face).\\n\\n    *   **Types of Deep Learning Networks:**\\n        *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Excellent for image and video processing.\\n        *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Well-suited for sequential data like text and time series.  LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) are a popular type of RNN.\\n        *   **Transformers:**  A more recent architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing.  They use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input.\\n\\n3.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**\\n\\n    *   **What it is:**  Focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\\n\\n    *   **How it works:** NLP uses a combination of techniques, including:\\n        *   *Text Analysis:* Breaking down text into its components (words, sentences, etc.).\\n        *   *Syntax Analysis:* Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences.\\n        *   *Semantic Analysis:* Understanding the meaning of words and sentences.\\n        *   *Sentiment Analysis:* Determining the emotional tone of a text.\\n        *   *Machine Translation:* Converting text from one language to another.\\n        *   *Text Generation:* Creating new text, such as summaries, articles, or dialogues.\\n\\n    *   **Examples:** Chatbots, machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization.\\n\\n4.  **Expert Systems:**\\n\\n    *   **What it is:**  Computer programs designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a specific domain.\\n\\n    *   **How it works:**  Expert systems typically consist of:\\n        *   *Knowledge Base:* A collection of facts and rules about the domain.\\n        *   *Inference Engine:*  A mechanism that applies the rules in the knowledge base to the facts to reach conclusions.\\n        *   *User Interface:*  Allows users to interact with the system.\\n\\n    *   **Examples:** Medical diagnosis systems, financial planning systems.\\n\\n5.  **Robotics:**\\n\\n    *   **What it is:**  The design, construction, operation, and application of robots. AI plays a role in enabling robots to perform tasks autonomously, adapt to changing environments, and interact with humans.\\n\\n    *   **How it works:**  AI is used in robotics for:\\n        *   *Perception:*  Using sensors (cameras, lidar, etc.) to understand the environment.\\n        *   *Planning:*  Developing plans for achieving goals.\\n        *   *Control:*  Controlling the robot\\'s movements.\\n        *   *Human-Robot Interaction:*  Enabling robots to communicate and collaborate with humans.\\n\\n**The AI Development Process (Simplified)**\\n\\n1.  **Define the Problem:** Clearly state what you want the AI system to achieve.\\n2.  **Gather Data:** Collect and prepare the data needed to train the AI model. Data quality is *crucial*.\\n3.  **Choose an Algorithm/Approach:** Select the most appropriate AI technique (e.g., supervised learning, deep learning, expert system) based on the problem and the available data.\\n4.  **Train the Model:** Feed the data into the algorithm and allow it to learn.\\n5.  **Evaluate the Model:** Assess the model\\'s performance on a separate dataset to ensure it generalizes well.\\n6.  **Deploy and Monitor:** Integrate the model into a real-world application and continuously monitor its performance.  Retrain the model as needed to maintain accuracy.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Data is King:**  AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on.  Biased or incomplete data can lead to inaccurate or unfair results.\\n*   **Explainability:**  Understanding why an AI model makes a particular decision is important, especially in critical applications.  Some AI models (like deep learning models) can be difficult to interpret (the \"black box\" problem).\\n*   **Ethical Implications:** AI raises important ethical questions about bias, fairness, privacy, and job displacement.\\n*   **Computational Resources:** Training complex AI models can require significant computing power (GPUs, cloud computing).\\n\\n**In Summary**\\n\\nAI is a powerful and rapidly evolving field. It works by using various techniques to enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine learning, especially deep learning, is the dominant approach today, but other techniques like expert systems and robotics also play important roles. The key to successful AI development is to carefully define the problem, gather high-quality data, choose the right algorithm, and continuously monitor and improve the system\\'s performance.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run-b9121d2b-6d5f-427d-a231-3198d27bf5bf-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4, 'output_tokens': 1874, 'total_tokens': 1878, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = ∑dk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network.

For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized.

The best performing such models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attentionm echanisms.  We propose a novel, simple network architecture based solely onan attention mechanism, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superiorin quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less timeto train. Our single model with 165 million parameters, achieves 27.5 BLEU onEnglish-to-German translation, improving over the existing best ensemble result by over 1 BLEU.
